# scribbles
This is basically a small notepad you can use in the terminal.
create an alias for calling the scribbles.sh file and run it from anywhere.

It runs allowing you to type line by line. It only stops when you hit ctrl+c to abort the process
After aborting it will save your thoughts to a file called "scribbles.txt". It will save in your home directory by default.
