# scribbles ver.2000
- This is basically a small notepad you can use in the terminal.
- Create an alias for calling the scribbles.sh file and run it from anywhere.

- It runs line by line. No editing. Just raw thoughts. 
- It only stops when you hit ctrl+c to quit.
- After quitting out, it will save your thoughts to a file called "scribbles.txt". It will save in your home directory by default.
